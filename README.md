# Module 10A – StudentCard Code Review

## Description
This is a React code review assignment. I reviewed the StudentCard component and added comments to 
explain the logic behind props, state, and interactivity.

## What I Learned
- How to use and identify props and state
  I got a better understanding of how props are just values passed in from the parent component to display stuff like the student's name or image. I also saw how state is used to control something that changes, like whether the bio is showing or not.
- How toggle functionality works with useState
  I learned how to use useState to store whether the bio is visible, and how clicking a button can change that value back and forth. Writing the toggle function helped me see how easy it is to make a component interactive.
- How to better document and explain React components
  Adding comments made me think more carefully about what each part of the code was doing. It also helped me explain things clearly, which I think is important when working on code with other people.
